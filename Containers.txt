A container is a standardized unit that holds the Code and its dependencies

Docker is a runtime that packages, deploys and monitors containers.

Some AWS container Orchestrate Services are:
   * Amazon Elastic container Service
   * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

If you must implement a serverless architecture, the compute option to use will be AWS Fargate. 

Fargate is a serverless compute service that works with container orchestrate services in AWS.
Container images are created and deployed in the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) where the orchestrate service will pull
and deploy on Fargate.
